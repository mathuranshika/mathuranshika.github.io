I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in Economics at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence.
I completed my undergraduate studies at Shivaji College, University of Delhi, and my Master’s in Economics from Ambedkar University Delhi. My research interests include health, gender, and labor economics. My dissertation explores how public policies, demographic changes, and social norms interact to shape women’s well-being and economic participation in India.
