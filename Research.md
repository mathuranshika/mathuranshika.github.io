<p align="justify"> Abstract: We study the impact of a maternity benefit conditional cash transfer scheme in India on child and maternal outcomes. By leveraging spatial and temporal variations in implementation and eligibility, Difference-inDifferences (DID) matching estimates reveal reduced neonatal mortality. Using variation in transfer size, we establish the importance of cash amount. Meeting conditionalities do not appear to be the key driver. The transfer itself may have increased quality of nutrition and healthcare utilization. The muted effects on maternal outcomes raise concerns regarding fulfilling program conditionalities by mothers. Our findings are robust to sample restrictions, falsification tests, and supported by exact randomization tests. </p>

<p align="justify"> Abstract: This study examines the impact of grandchild care on the labor market outcomes of grandparents amid the rapid aging and feminization of the global population. Employing an instrumental variable approach, we find a substantial negative effect on the employment rate of grandmothers, particularly for those cohabiting with their children, while no significant effect is observed for grandfathers. These findings suggest that grandchild caregiving contributes to the gender gap in labor force participation among the elderly, with a more pronounced effect in urban areas. We also find that the reduction in labor supply occurs primarily among younger grandmothers, indicating an early withdrawal from the workforce.</p>
